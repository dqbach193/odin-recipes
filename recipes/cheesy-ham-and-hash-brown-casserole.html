        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This ham and hash brown casserole is quick and easy to make, not to mention delicious! I mostly serve this as a breakfast casserole, but it's great anytime. It may be served with or without diced ham.</p>

            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 (32 ounce) package frozen hash brown potatoes</li>
            <li>2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed cream of potato soup</li>
